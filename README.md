# PTinside
Pobierz, Podłącz, Prze**dir**uj

I am working on an advanced spyware and remote control solution...
# What is PTinside?
It's a keylogger and remote control program.
# How to use it?
Simply download and run my *install.bat* file as administrator.<br/>
It will install PTupdater.
# What is PTupdater?
It's an automated update script.<br/>
It will download PTinside for the first time and continuously check for updates in background.
# How to use the keylogger?
It is disabled in code by default. You must uncomment it (see comments) and compile using Microsoft Visual Studio.<br/>
You must also modify the installation script (replace INSERT...HERE by Your FTP server's login data).
# How to use the remote control?
You must modify URLs in code to use Your own control panel.<br/>
However, You can use demo version: https://piotr-trybisz.000webhostapp.com/!vlo/remote/index.html <br/>
**Notice: anyone can do anything in this demo control panel!**
